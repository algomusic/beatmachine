The Beat Machines are a family of bespoke percussion synthesizer / sequencers designed and made by Andrew R. Brown and John Ferguson using DIY electronics. They feature low cost microcontrollers and user interfaces featuring circulr designs representing rhythmic cycles.
A range of Beat Machines have been made, the first was a PCB-based designed using two Arduino Nano microcontrollers unning the [Mozzi Audio library](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/). The Beat Machine S3 series featured an ESP32-S3 microcontroller using the [M16 audio library](https://github.com/algomusic/M16) and came in two variants, a circular PCB design and a larger 'wooden' version in a laser cut wooden enclosure.
